Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.Software engineering is important in the society because it helps in solving of real life problems 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The first is the discovery of a programming language and this is essential because it helped us to communicate with computers more easily .
The formation of structured programming in 1970 
the rise of agile methods in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall method is a sequential approach with distict phases flowing downwards wile agile methods is an incremental approach focused on flexibility ,collaboration and responding to change 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer-the main role of a software developer is to create and maintain software solution 
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
this are tools that provide comprehensive toolsfor writting,debugging and testing code .
visual studio
Version control-this are tools that track the changes to source code and coordinating work among team members git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests, which are located near the application's source, test the distinct methods and features of the classes, parts, or modules that your software uses.  It guarantees that every unit, separate from other components, carries out its intended function as intended.
  Integration tests: confirm that the various services or modules your application uses are compatible with one another.
  aid in making sure interfaces function as intended and data moves across modules without hiccups.
  System testing: Examine the software system as a whole, taking into account all of its features and interactions.
  -It assists in confirming that the system satisfies all functional and non-functional requirements, such as security, usability, and performance.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is a way that you give the AI clear instructions so that it can give you as accurate of a result as possible.
 -If you want AI to do exactly what you need, you must know how to talk to it.
Just like learning a new language, you’ll be able to give clear instructions to your AI assistant!
The better your prompt, the better the AI’s response!

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-vague prompt-write a poem
-improved prompt-write a one paragraph poem about a girl called Wanjiru and mention that here eyes are beautiful to look at and she feels like a cold soda on a sunny evening
